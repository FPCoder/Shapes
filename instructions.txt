In groups of 2 or 3, develop a pure abstract class called "Shape", with the following members:

-public:
    - get functions for retrieving the area and perimeter
    - pure virtual functions for calculating the area and perimeter
-private:
    - double variables for storing the area and perimeter

Next, define 3 classes of shapes, each with a different number of sides, that all derive from "Shape".

For each class, implement the functions for calulating area and perimeter.

Include a driver that instantiates several instances of each shape and calculates area and perimeter.
